> Quickly get setup with a project setup

## Generating a project

Getting a project installed is managed by the command line tool [cartridge-cli](https://github.com/cartridge/cartridge-cli).

```bash
cartridge new
```

The generated project uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) as a task runner and as a base only includes the skeleton of a project.

Modules (Expansion packs) can be chosen during installation to give extra functionality.

A few that may be useful:

* [cartridge-sass](https://github.com/cartridge/cartridge-sass) - Sass compilation
* [cartridge-javascript](https://github.com/cartridge/cartridge-javascript) - Script compilation, linting, documentation
* [cartridge-images](https://github.com/cartridge/cartridge-images) - Image optimisation
